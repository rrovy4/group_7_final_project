# group_7_final_project

## Overview

The purpose of our project is to analyze Killed and Seriously Injured data taken from the Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal and determine which areas are considered high risk for fatal and non-fatal collisions. This analysis will help inform daily commuters of these high risk areas and aid city officials develope proper safety measures to reduce the number of collisions.

## Questions

- Which areas (neghborhoods/districts) in Toronto are prone to fatal and non-fatal collisions?

  - Strategy: Perform explaratory analysis on collision rates by neighborhood/district groups.

## Additional Questions to Consider

- Which factors contribute the most to collisions (Lighting, time of day, weather, seasons, holidays, alcohol)?
- Which road classes are more likely to see collisions (highways, intersections, etc)?
- Which vehicle types are more likely to be involved in a collision (car, motoorcylcle, bicycle)?
- Can we predict where collision are likely to occur?

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Sci-kit)
- Tableau
- SQL Alchemy
- Postgres
- Logistic Regression Machine Learning or SVM
