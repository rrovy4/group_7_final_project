UofT_Group_7_Final_Project
The purpose of our project is to analyze Killed and Seriously Injured data taken from the Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal and determine which areas are considered high risk for fatal and non-fatal collisions. This analysis will help inform daily commuters of these high risk areas and aid city officials develope proper safety measures to reduce the number of collisions.

Would like to show some basic visuals on the following topics.

1. A districtwide visualization of all the collisions in Toronto. The same can also be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/AdistrictwidevisualizationofallthecollisionsinToronto[â€¦]to_?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
