# group_7_final_project

## Overview

The purpose of our project is to analyze Killed and Seriously Injured data taken from the Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal and determine which areas are considered high risk for fatal and non-fatal collisions. This analysis will help inform daily commuters of these high risk areas and aid city officials develope proper safety measures to reduce the number of collisions.

## Questions

- Which areas (neghborhoods/districts) in Toronto are prone to fatal and non-fatal collisions?

  - Strategy: Perform explaratory analysis on collision rates by neighborhood/district groups.

## Additional Questions to Consider

- Which factors contribute the most to collisions (Lighting, time of day, weather, seasons, holidays, alcohol)?
- Which road classes are more likely to see collisions (highways, intersections, etc)?
- Which vehicle types are more likely to be involved in a collision (car, motoorcylcle, bicycle)?
- Can we predict where collision are likely to occur?

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Sci-kit)
- Tableau
- SQL Alchemy
- Postgres
- Logistic Regression Machine Learning or SVM

# Deliverable 2

The purpose of our project is to analyze Killed and Seriously Injured data taken from the Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal and determine which areas are considered high risk for fatal and non-fatal collisions. This analysis will help inform daily commuters of these high risk areas and aid city officials develope proper safety measures to reduce the number of collisions.

# Machine Learning

In order to use our dataset to predict future fatal and non-fatal collisions, we will need to select a machine learning model for our analysis. To achieve this, we will be testing the following models:

- Oversampling (Random Oversampler and SMOTE)
- Undersampling (Cluster Centroids)
- Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble Classifier


## Results

Our analysis produced the following results:

## Summary

After testing six machine learning models, we found that the Balanced Random Forest Classifier produced the highest accuracy rating. While this model did produce high precision, recall and f1 scores for non-fatal collisions, fatal collisions earned low precision and f1 scores, and a high recall score. This means that this model will have a large number of false positives and a low number of false negatives.

Since the majority of all fatal collisions are being classified correctly, additional testing will be required to address the large amount of false positives in this class. This is not a major issue though, as it is better to have false positives for fatal collisions than for non-fatal. Whether or not resources are available to perform additional testing, we recoomend moving forward with the Balanced Random Forest Classifier model.
